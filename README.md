# blending-simulator
This software simulates the stacking and reclaiming process in bulk material blending beds.

## Build
Use QtCreator to open Qbs project file and compile with c++11.

## Usage
To execute the binary pass one of the output files generated by [blending-control](https://github.com/jcbachmann/blending-control) (stack or reclaim) as paramter.

In case of the stack file the stockpile will be simualted and a simulated reclaimer output file will be generated. In case of the reclaim fail the output format is adapted to match the simulation output format for easy comparison.

A configuration file `processing.config` is generated with default parameters on first execution and placed next to the binary. This file can be modified to match the real world model.
